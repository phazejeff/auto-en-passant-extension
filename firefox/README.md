# Dear Mozilla,
I understand that you disagree with Google's changes to their new version of the extension standard. I get it, I'm on your side with this one. But, as a developer, at least support the new standard. You can go and add your additional features on top of the standard, but like bro, I made this for chrome first and then had to downgrade to the version 2 of the extension manifest and change my code to get it to work. It only took a few minutes, but now I have 2 seperate folders with extremely similar files so that I cant support both browsers. It's not a big deal, but it's annoying. plz fix thank.
