# auto-en-passant-extension
A chrome/firefox extension that automatically plays en passant if it's avaliable

This includes the [chess.js library](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) by jhlywa because browsers seem to get very angry when you try to run code from an external source via an extension
